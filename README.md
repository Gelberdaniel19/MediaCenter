This application is meant for people that store a lot of movies on their computer and want a simple and elegant way to store them on a simple Netflix-like platform.
With this program, users can add movies by telling the path to the movie on their hard drive and entering the IMDb link to the movie, so it can gather information for display on the sidebar.
Once a movie is added into the program, it can be played, downloaded back onto the hard drive, or deleted.

## Setup ##

Once the program is up and running, there are some things you will want to do. The most important thing you need to do is make a folder somewhere on your hard drive where the app can store its data. Once created, you can hook the app up to it with File > Set Target Directory.
In order to get optimal performance, try to put the movies onto the same hard drive as the target destination, or it will take significant time to copy into the target directory.
After that, feel free to add movies as you wish. If when you add a movie, it takes more than a few seconds to show up, there was likely an error accessing IMDb. Check your internet connection and try again.

### About ###

This app was mostly meant as a practice program for MVC design and JavaFX, as I have never implemented MVC in a legitimate project and I have never used the FXML portion of JavaFX before.
